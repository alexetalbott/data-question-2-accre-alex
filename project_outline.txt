Initial subset
    - limit 10,000 rows

Goal 1: Cleaning the dataset
    - Columns:
        - Ignore:
            - JobIDRaw
            - Cluster
            - UID
            - JobName
        - Keep
            - Partition
            - Account
            - Group
            - GID
            - User
            - Submit
            - Eligible
            - Start
            - End
            - Elapsed
            - ExitCode
            - State
            - NNodes
            -NCPUS
            -ReqCPUS
            -ReqMem
            -ReqGRES
            -ReqTRES
            -Timelimit
            -NodeList
            -JobName
    - Plots to visualize data
        - box plot to see if there outliers in number of jobs run per User and per Group
        - time series (monthly trend)
        - Table of Node failures by NodeList [Alex - refers to Node question below]
        
Q1: Davis
    1. As you request more ram, how does that impact your Queue time?
    2. As you request more time, how does that impact your Queue time? [Davis]
        **Queue time = Start time - Submit time (time it is waiting in the Queue)

Q2: Alex
    3. Nodes that are leading to a disproportionate number of failures [Alex]
        - State column: message saying something along the lines of "Node Failure" --> what job is that node running on?

Q3: Amrit
    4. Problematic users who are running lots of sort jobs [Amrit]
        - If a user runs greater than 500 jobs, each less than 5 minutes, within 4 hours
            â—‹ If you don't catch anyone in this category, expand slowly until you start collecting problematic users
